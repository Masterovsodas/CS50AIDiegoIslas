    --If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

    --I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there WITHDRAWING some money.

    --As the thief was leaving the bakery, THEY CALLED someone who talked to them for LESS THAN A MINUTE. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the EARLIEST
    --FLIGHT out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

    --I'm the bakery owner, and someone came in, suspiciously whispering into a phone for about half an hour. They never bought anything. (WEAK, could have been anyone)
