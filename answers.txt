sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Consistently the slowest algorithm, especially in when sorting item heavy arrays. However when sorting a presorted array, it is consistently the fastest; this hints at the fact that sort1 has a condition top quit when an array 
is already sorted. Bubble sort is the only algorithm that behaves so slowly, yet has an efficient lower bound.
