Loading the data for this project was not particularly hard, just required some researcdh on the functionality of OpenCV as well as some practice in manipulating path strings.
Once reaching the model development stage I ran looked over TensorFlow's documentation and used the lecture source code as a starting point / model for testing. Initially it was highly inaccurate. To counteract this i decided to do a second iteration of image convolution before implementing the pooling layer, so that pools could be more dense in relevant information. This increased accuraccy, but not to a satisfactorey level. Howerver due to its previous success, I added another convolution and pooling layer after the first pooling layer. This increaced accuracy significantly but still not to an acceptable standpoint. After some arbitrary testing, I noticed that removing dropout and keeping the associated hidden layer from the lecture model incresed performance and accuracy exponentially. Oddly, this caused no real issues with overfitting, at least from my understanding, since the test loss actually went down with this change. Thus I kept this final model, recorded it, and have submitted it in this final format.
