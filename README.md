#### Video Demo:  <https://studio.youtube.com/video/r0WtygM26pA/edit>
#### Description:
Soos' mystery is an online flask application which employs python, HTML, CSS, and SQLite3 in order to create an interactive and thematic website.
In this application the user is tasked with analyszing interviews and deciphering cryptograms in order to uncover the mystery of who stole Soo's cart.
In order to do so they must think critically about the story and learn to serpate themselves and their reasoning from the narrator, they must analyze web pages
closely and find secrets that propagate new information or give a new angle for the user to think / solve from. In the end from interviews and ciphers alone, they must deduce who the
criminal is and who helped them steal the cart. Along the way, much misleading information and emotions are put into the story in order to create the afforemetioned sense of
independace within the user as well as challenge the user's logic and suggestability, making the game more psychologically difficult and complex than one with simple hard evidence would.
Over the course of the game, the user is given their own tab in which to note logs, these logs are saved via SQL and are useful for recording the events of the story, opinions, and cryptograms.
Once the user has deduced the criminals, they can go to the ACCUSE tab and fill in the 3 pieces of information required to win the game. If they are wrong they lose, no second chances!
Only a username is required to log into the site, since there are many secret usernames with creative and and comical logs, registered as secrets. That is a brief but well-rounded overview of my project, the rest is further illustrated in my video.
